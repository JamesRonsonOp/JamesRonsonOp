### Data Modeling and Analysis Projects
_____

* **Wine Varietal Predictor:** Modeled a 21-class predictor using a convolutional neural net that was able to predict wine varietals 3 times better than the baseline. 
* **Auto Accident Severity Predictor:** Deployed a webapp that predicted auto accident severity as part of a team working on a data set with over 4.2 million observations.
* **Social Media Classifier:** Extracted 6000+ social media posts from two different Reddit threads and processed them through a Natural Language Processing workflow that used a Voting Classifier model to classify them with a balanced accuracy of over 90% versus a baseline of 27.5%.
* **Real Estate Price Predictor:** Analyzed a housing dataset with over 82 features to identify relationships and build a predictor model that could determine a housing price within less than 10% of its actual value. 
* **STEM-Readiness Analysis:** Analyzed National and State of California ACT data to find relationships between size and type of school district and the influence on ACT science and math scores. 
* **Distribution Expansion Analysis:** Analyzed demographic information of 6 potential regions to determine the best location for a regional distribution hub.
